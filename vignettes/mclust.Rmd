`mclust` is a R package that offers
- model-based clustering: `Mclust`
- classification ( discrimininant analysis): `MclustDA`
- density estimation `densityMclust`
all based on mixtures of Normals.

`condvis2` offers an interface to all of these.

We start with 

## Classification: MclustDA

```{r}
library(condvis2)
library(mclust)
```

```{r}
data(banknote)
bankDA <- MclustDA(banknote[,-1], banknote[,1])
```

This fits an XXX=ellipsoidal multivariate normal for the genuine notes and
EVE2 = ellipsoidal, equal volume and equal shape with two components for
 counterfeits.

```{r echo=F, eval=F}
bankDA$models$genuine$modelName
bankDA$models$genuine$G

bankDA$models$counterfeit$modelName
bankDA$models$counterfeit$G

bankDA$models$counterfeit
```




```{r eval=F}
svars <- c("Top", "Diagonal")
cvars <- setdiff(names(banknote)[-1], svars)
condvis(data = banknote, model = bankDA, 
        response="Status", sectionvars=svars,conditionvars=cvars, 
        pointColor="Status", showsim=TRUE
        )
```


The `showsim=TRUE` setting means that the condition plots will mark points considered
sufficiently near the section with a dark outline. This is the default setting only
when $n <= 150$. One the condition plots, the green points are the genuine ones, pink
are counterfeit.

Here is a views of the result:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/mclustda1.png')
```
There is one point that appears to be mis-classified. However, as it's size is small it is not very close
to the section.

Selecting `Show probs`: we see there is some uncertainty about the classification on the classification
boundaries.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/mclustda2.png')
```

Condvis uses a generic `CVpredict` to provide a uniform interface to `predict` methods.
We will use it to find the number of misclassifications:

```{r}
table(banknote$Status, CVpredict(bankDA, banknote))
```




A different, simpler fit is got using

```{r}
bankDAe <- MclustDA(banknote[,-1], banknote[,1], modelType="EDDA")
```

This uses an EVE1 for each class, and there is one mis-classification, at case 70.



We can use condvis to compare the two fits:

```{r eval=F}
condvis(data = banknote, model = list(bankDA=bankDA, bankDAe=bankDAe), 
        response="Status", sectionvars=svars,conditionvars=cvars, 
        pointColor="Status", showsim=T,
        )
```

If you go to Tour, `Diff fits`, you can move through views where the
conditioning points are those where the fits disagree. In this case there is
only one such point.

The screenshot shows that in this view.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/mclustda4.png')
```
The mis-classified point is genuine note classified as counterfeit by EDDA.
